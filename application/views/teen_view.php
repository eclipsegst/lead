Teen Institute
</h2>

<div class="well">
Teen Institute (TI) is a 7-day training camp designed to teach Deaf and Hard of Hearing teens to be education and prevention advocates among their peers. Recognizing that teens influence their peers, the curriculum focuses of drug and alcohol abuse prevention, HIV/AIDS awareness, and other issues critical to teenagers. Drug and alcohol abuse is a critical issue facing todayâ€™s youth. Participants will leave TI equipped with the basic knowledge, skills, and understanding to work with adult sponsors to promote alcohol and drug abuse prevention in their home, school, and community. Teen Institute is a collaborative effort between the L.E.A.D. Institute and the Department of Mental Health-Drug and Alcohol Abuse.
